This repository contains gene expression data for use with [POTAGE](https://github.com/CroBiA/potage). The data is derived from
[RNA-Seq data](https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/files/RNASeqWheat/) generated by the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium
(IWGSC). For information on the structure and format of files contained in, please see [expression/README.md](/expression/README.md)

# Description of the Data set

Briefly, the data set contains 15 conditions (5 organs each at 3 developmental stages) with 2 replicates each. For full details, see
the [READ_ME](https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/files/RNASeqWheat/READ_ME) file at URGI.

# How we Derived the Expression Values

The raw data for this data set is available from [URGI](https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/files/RNASeqWheat/).
