  1. [Global](./global) - the core precomputed information on which POTAGE is built
  2. [Expression](./expression) - the gene expression data sets for visualisation within POTAGE

You are most likely to want to add additional gene expression data sets to POTAGE, so we describe here the process for doing so.
